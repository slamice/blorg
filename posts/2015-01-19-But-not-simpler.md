> Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler

As both a developer and support engineer this point frustrates me to no end, *simply* because people break this principle a lot. It comes up all the time when you work in software. [KISS](https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/KISS_principle.html). Everyone agrees that ideally things best be clear, concise, understandable, scalable, ... _Simple_.

Defining simplicity itself is hard. [Watch this Ted Talk because it's awesome and way more entertaining than a dictionary](http://www.ted.com/talks/george_whitesides_toward_a_science_of_simplicity#t-104011).

What is simplicty when it comes to software?

> Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible

However, the devil is in the details, so when you start throwing in tons of design patterns and hunky frameworks and all that stuff then you suffer. Because you have to take care of all of these things and it gets complicated.

But it has to work the other way around too:

> but Not Simpler

Because, as Mr. Whitesides wearing a black suit says, if things are too simple then the function of it is gone. It doesn't work anymore. We shouldn't forget who we're working for. The design should be independent from the implementation.
